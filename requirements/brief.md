## 1. The Problem

Knowledge, whether for personal study or professional system design, is a network of interconnected concepts. Traditional tools like documents and spreadsheets force this network into a linear or tabular format, obscuring critical relationships and hindering deep understanding. This leads to information silos, missed insights, and a fragmented view of complex systems. There is a need for a simple, accessible tool that treats knowledge as what it is: a graph.

## 2. The Vision: Our Solution

**GRAPH is a lightweight, client-side web application that empowers users to build and explore directed knowledge graphs.**

By providing a simple, interactive interface to create "Nodes" (concepts) and "Links" (relationships), GRAPH transforms abstract information into a tangible, navigable map. It moves beyond linear note-taking, allowing users to see the bigger picture and understand how individual pieces of information connect. The entire experience is designed to be self-contained within the browser, requiring no backend, no sign-up, and no complex setup—making it an instant, personal knowledge-mapping workspace.

## 3. Target Audience

This application is primarily for individuals who engage in systems thinking and need to map complex information structures. This includes:

*   **Developers & Architects** mapping software components.
*   **Students & Researchers** organizing study topics and sources.
*   **Technical Writers** structuring complex documentation.
*   **Anyone** practicing non-linear, associative note-taking.

## 4. Core Objectives

We will achieve our vision by focusing on four key objectives:

1.  **Empower Fluid Exploration:** Create an instantly responsive, single-page application where navigating and editing the graph feels as fluid as thought.
2.  **Provide a "Zero-Effort" Personal Workspace:** Ensure all user work is automatically and persistently saved in the browser, creating a reliable, always-on workspace without the need for manual saving.
3.  **Ensure User Ownership and Data Portability:** Guarantee that users have full control over their data through simple, robust JSON export and import functionality.
4.  **Facilitate Structural Insight:** Equip users with simple analytical tools to quickly assess the state of their graph, such as identifying its density or finding incomplete entries.

## 5. Scope & Boundaries

To deliver a focused and high-quality product, the initial scope is intentionally constrained.

#### **In-Scope:**

*   Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for Nodes and Links.
*   A single-user experience with all data persisted locally in the browser (`localStorage`).
*   A two-panel UI for global and focused views of the graph.
*   JSON-based import and export of the entire graph.
*   Basic discovery tools (search, stats, finding nodes/links by properties).

#### **Out-of-Scope:**

*   **No user accounts or cloud synchronization.** This is a client-side-only application.
*   **No real-time multi-user collaboration.**
*   **No advanced visuals.** (e.g., visual representations vith geometry, shapes, colors on canvas or in SVG).
*   **No automated graph layout algorithms.** The layout is driven by user navigation.
  
Anything and all of the above can be added as future enhancements, when the base functionality is in place.

## 6. Measures of Success

The project will be considered a success when:

*   A user can create a graph, close the browser, and return to find their work perfectly preserved.
*   Core user flows—such as creating a node, linking it to another, and navigating to it—are intuitive and can be completed without referencing documentation.
*   The application can successfully export a graph and re-import it into a clean session, restoring the identical state.
*   The UI remains responsive and performant, even with a graph of several hundred nodes and links.
