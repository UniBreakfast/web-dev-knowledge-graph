# **IMPORTANT:** Adhere strictly to the following guidelines when making changes to this project:

# **Coding Style:**
# - Use 2-space indentation for all code files (HTML, CSS, JS).
# - Do NOT use trailing semicolons in JavaScript.
# - Assign event handlers using .onevent properties (e.g., element.onclick = handler) instead of addEventListener.

# **Code Content:**
# - Do NOT add comments within the code files (HTML, CSS, JS).
# - Do NOT change existing data structures (like the `nodes` object) unless explicitly instructed to do so.
# - Do NOT modify existing styles in `style.css` unless specifically prompted.

# By following these rules, you ensure consistency, maintainability, and alignment with the project's established conventions.
