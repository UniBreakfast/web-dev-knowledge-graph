      "G - Golf": "Golf is a precision sport played on a large outdoor course, where players use clubs to hit a small ball into a series of holes with as few strokes as possible. Originating in 15th-century Scotland, golf is now a globally popular game known for its leisurely yet competitive nature. The NATO phonetic alphabet uses \"Golf\" to represent the letter G because the word is easily recognizable and distinct, even in noisy or unclear communication. Golf courses, with their lush greens and sand traps, are iconic landscapes, and the sport is often associated with patience, strategy, and skill."

    "2": {
      "R - Romeo": "Romeo represents the letter R in the NATO phonetic alphabet, inspired by the famous romantic hero from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. The name \"Romeo\" is universally familiar, making it an effective code word in radio transmissions. In literature, Romeo symbolizes passion and dramatic love, while in military and aviation communications, it serves as a clear and unambiguous identifier. The use of such a well-known name ensures that the letter R is never mistaken for similar-sounding letters."
    },
    "3": {
      "A - Alpha": "Alpha stands for the letter A and is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, often associated with beginnings, leadership, and dominance (as in \"alpha male\"). In the NATO phonetic alphabet, \"Alpha\" is chosen for its clarity and resistance to confusion. The word is short, sharp, and easily distinguishable from other letters, even in poor transmission conditions. Beyond its military use, \"Alpha\" is widely used in science, mathematics, and finance to denote primary or initial elements."
    },
    "4": {
      "P - Papa": "Papa, meaning \"father\" in many Romance languages, represents the letter P in the NATO phonetic alphabet. This term is used because it is simple, universally understood, and unlikely to be misheard. Unlike words that might sound similar in different languages, \"Papa\" is distinct and easily recognizable. In family contexts, \"Papa\" conveys warmth and authority, while in radio communications, it serves as a precise and efficient way to convey the letter P without ambiguity."
    },
    "5": {
      "H - Hotel": "Hotel stands for the letter H and refers to establishments that provide lodging and hospitality services. The word is chosen in the NATO phonetic alphabet because it is internationally recognized and phonetically distinct. Hotels are a fundamental part of global travel, making the term familiar across cultures. In military and aviation communications, \"Hotel\" ensures that H is not confused with similar-sounding letters like A (\"Alpha\") or J (\"Juliet\")."

    "1_2": "Short arrow below the letters G and R in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Golf to Romeo. Golf, a game of patience and precision, unfolds on sprawling green courses where players chase a tiny ball — much like Romeo chased love in Verona’s moonlit streets. A golfer’s perfect swing mirrors Romeo’s passionate soliloquies: both require timing, grace, and a touch of reckless hope. Perhaps a wayward golf ball soars over a hedge and lands at the feet of a stranger, sparking a meet-cute worthy of Shakespeare. Or maybe, after a frustrating round, a golfer retreats to the clubhouse bar, where a chance encounter over whiskey ignites a romance as dramatic as Romeo and Juliet. After all, both love and golf are games of risk, reward, and the occasional unplayable lie.",
    "3_1": "Long arrow above the letters A and G in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Alpha to Golf. Alpha, the first, the leader, the origin — naturally begets Golf, the sport of kings and CEOs. Just as alpha wolves command their packs, golf commands respect as the ultimate test of discipline and strategy. The connection runs deeper: ancient Scottish shepherds, the \"alphas\" of their flocks, are said to have invented golf by whacking stones into rabbit holes. Even today, the alpha executive seals billion-dollar deals on the 18th green, where power and precision intersect. Golf courses are modern-day proving grounds for alphas, where a single stroke can mean triumph or humiliation. From battlefield commanders to corporate titans, those who lead often play the game — because to master golf is to master patience, control, and the art of the comeback.",
    "3_2": "Short arrow above the letters A and R in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Alpha to Romeo. Alpha, the beginning, the spark — what is Romeo if not the alpha of his own tragic love story? He is the initiator, the one who scales walls and defies fate for passion. In the animal kingdom, the alpha leads the pack; in Verona, Romeo leads with his heart, reckless and bold. Alpha energy is magnetic, and Romeo’s charisma draws Juliet — and disaster — like a moth to flame. But there’s a darker twist: Romeo is also the anti-alpha, a dreamer who buckles under pressure, whose love is all-or-nothing. An alpha dominates; Romeo surrenders. Yet in his defiance of family and feud, he becomes a different kind of leader — one who proves that love, not power, is the ultimate force. Alpha begins the story, but Romeo rewrites it. There's also the famous car brand Alfa Romeo, which combines the idea of leadership (Alpha) with the romantic allure of the name Romeo, creating a symbol of speed and passion on the road.",
    "3_4": "Short arrow below the letters A and P in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Alpha to Papa. Alpha, the origin of all things, carries the primal weight of creation — and what follows creation but legacy? Enter Papa, the patriarch, the protector, the first teacher. In nature, the alpha wolf fathers the pack; in humanity, the papa guides the family. The word itself is a linguistic offspring of \"alpha,\" echoing through Latin (papa) and Greek (pappas), a tender twist on the original power. An alpha CEO becomes \"Papa\" to his employees; a revolutionary leader becomes the \"father\" of a nation. Even in myth, sky-gods like Zeus (the ultimate alpha) are called pater. Authority softens into nurture, dominance into care — but the thread remains unbroken. Alpha roars; Papa whispers. Yet both command reverence.",
    "3_5": "Long arrow below the letters A and H in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Alpha to Hotel. Alpha is the first, the pioneer — and what symbolizes human exploration better than the hotel? Ancient alphas led tribes to new lands; today, hotels house modern wanderers in foreign cities. The grand hotels of the 19th century — The Ritz, The Savoy — were temples of alpha ambition, where tycoons and spies sealed fates over champagne. Even linguistically, \"hotel\" stems from hospes, Latin for \"host\" or \"stranger\", a role the alpha must play: welcoming, guarding, or conquering the unknown. A luxury suite is a alpha’s den of deal-making; a backpacker hostel, a democratic alpha’s commune. From nomadic chieftains to today’s jet-setters, the instinct is the same: rest, regroup, and reign.",
    "5_4": "Short arrow above the letters H and P in the title image of the word \"GRAPH\", leading from Hotel to Papa. A hotel is a transient home, but within its walls, papa emerges in unexpected ways. The night manager becomes a paternal figure to homesick staff; the regular guest, a fatherly mentor to young travelers. Think of The Grand Budapest Hotel’s M. Gustave, whose eccentric authority is pure papa-energy — strict yet sentimental. Or the real-life \"papa\" bartenders of historic hotels, who’ve listened to a million confessions over mahogany counters. Even linguistically, \"papa\" hides in hospitality, both rooted in caregiving. A five-star hotel shields like a patriarch; a roadside motel, with its flickering vacancy sign, offers the same weary promise: You’re safe here, child."
